      <h2>Our Values</h2><br>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>MISSION:</strong> Our mission is to be the voice of the people of West Village C and West Village F and to provide fun and engaging events for everyone. We plan to represent our constituency with the utmost vigilance and accuracy, consistently reaching out to the people of "the neighborhood" to determine the general opinions on what needs improvement.  We plan to use this website and the West Village C/F Facebook page as an open forum for YOUR ideas and suggestions on how to improve our community.  Many people have already expressed to us a desire to have a printer moved into the lobby of West Village F.  If elected, that will be our first order of business.</p><br>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;"><strong>VISION:</strong> We envision a politically active and engaged community that is run by a caring group of your peers.  West Village C and West Village F will be transformed by social, culinary, and entertaining events that benefit all.</p><br>
